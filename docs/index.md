# Overview
This is documentation is intended to guide Customer Success Managers (CSMs) at Balto through
the process of automated A/B testing provided by Balto Data Science (DS). Listed below are the high level steps
CSMs should take to conduct an A/B test (pilot) with a customer:

1. Create a card in [Data Science Work Requests Asana Board](https://app.asana.com/0/1200386241920646/board) to provide DS with initial information about the client,
the expected time frame of the test, etc.
2. Conduct a meeting with the client to establish what KPI(s) will be tested,
how their data tracking the relevant KPI is stored internally, and what data can be shared with Balto for the test.

    - Typically, DS is not needed in this meeting but can attend if necessary.
    - If DS does not attend the meeting, communicate the information you gathered to them in the Asana
   card created in step 1.
    - DS will communicate via Asana any additional questions or needs on the Balto side for the test
  after ingesting this initial information.<br><br>
    
3. After all necessary information to conduct the test is obtained by DS, the CSM has permission to set up a shared folder
on Google Drive where customer data can be readily accessed by both parties.
4. DS will set up automatic report generation for your specific test. Requests for report updates can be
made Ã  la carte, or you can request reports be sent directly to you at some level of frequency via email or Slack (e.g. daily, weekly). 
Either type of request should be made in the relevant Asana card.

Please refer to the remaining sections of this documentation for specifics
relevant to each step listed above.
