Listed below are the high level steps CSMs should take to conduct an A/B test (pilot) with a customer: Create a card in Data Science Work Requests Asana Board to provide DS with initial information about the client, the expected time frame of the test, etc. Conduct a meeting with the client to establish what KPI(s) will be tested, how their data tracking the relevant KPI is stored internally, and what data can be shared with Balto for the test. Typically, DS is not needed in this meeting but can attend if necessary. If DS does not attend the meeting, communicate the information you gathered to them in the Asana card created in step 1. DS will communicate via Asana any additional questions or needs on the Balto side for the test after ingesting this initial information. After all necessary information to conduct the test is obtained by DS, the CSM has permission to set up a shared folder on Google Drive where customer data can be readily accessed by both parties. DS will set up automatic report generation for your specific test. Requests for report updates can be made \u00e0 la carte, or you can request reports be sent directly to you at some level of frequency via email or Slack (e.g. daily, weekly). Either type of request should be made in the relevant Asana card. Please refer to the remaining sections of this documentation for specifics relevant to each step listed above. Example reports can be accessed by clicking on one of the examples listed in the sidebar.","title":"Overview"},{"location":"#overview","text":"This is documentation is intended to guide Customer Success Managers (CSMs) at Balto through the process of automated A/B testing provided by Balto Data Science (DS).

CUSTOMER should be informative to the specific customer the pilot is being conducted for, and DATA_FOLDER specific to a single pilot. An example of this file structure can be found here . When naming these folders, please avoid using capitalization, special characters and spaces as this can introduce unnecessary complications. For example, bradley_lead_group or blg are acceptable directory names, while Bradley Lead Group is not. If there are security requirements from a specific client that require FTP or something similar, DS will attempt to accommodate those needs. Examples Typically, customers share data in one of two formats--call-level data, or agent-time level data. Like the name implies, call-level data are records where each observation (or row) is a single call. To use call-level data during a test, DS at a bare minimum must know whether the call as successful, whether the call was made using Balto, and the date/time of the call. Agent-level data are records where each observation represents a single agent-time (e.g. day or week) combination. To use this type of data for a test the bare minimum DS needs are who the agent is, whether they are a Balto user, the time unit of observation, and the KPI value for each agent-time row. Below are example data sets for each general type of data.

We use statistical modeling, specifically mixed modeling to estimate the marginal impact of Balto usage while simultaneously controlling for as many potential confounding factors as possible. Why use a statistical model instead of comparing group level averages? Statistical ( regression ) models can account for other sources of variation in the KPI of interest besides Balto/non-Balto group assignment. Models can account for time explicitly. Group assignment may not be random or group size may be too small for randomization to produce groups that are statistically equivalent. Controlling for some group differences leads to a higher level of confidence that the Balto effect is really due to Balto and not some other source of variation. Regression models avoid unnecessary aggregations. As a general rule, statistical analyses should rely on as much relevant information as possible. Computing group-level or time-level statistics removes information about variation in performance across agents or time periods. Regression models can measure the magnitude of the Balto effect, formally test whether it is statistically different from zero, and compute confidence intervals to address uncertainty. How much data do I need? As a general rule of thumb, more data is always better. When conducting an A/B test or any experiment, sample size can be thought of as a 'net' to catch statistically significant effects. The larger the sample size, the smaller the holes in the net are. On the converse, when sample size is small the holes in the net are large. The implication of this is that a larger sample size is better because it enables us to catch a smaller effect. If sample size is not large enough, the holes in the metaphorical net may be too large to observe the occurrence of a small but significant effect. What is typically reported in the summary table? Estimated Balto effect : This is what is commonly referred to as 'lift' at Balto, and represents a percentage deviation from some baseline for the KPI being tested, typically the group average prior to starting the test. P-value : Determines whether the estimated Balto effect is 'statistically significant'. The general rule of thumb is the lower the p-value, the better. DS considers any p-value lower than 0.15 to be a statistically significant result. 95% CI lower/upper bound : The lower and upper bounds of a 95% confidence interval around the estimated Balto effect. The simplest way to interpret these two numbers are that they represent an upper and lower threshold in which DS has a given level of statistical certainty (specifically, 95% certainty) the true Balto effect falls within.","title":"FAQ"},{"location":"faq/#faq","text":"","title":"FAQ"},{"location":"faq/#what-is-dss-specific-methodology-for-conducting-the-test","text":"We use statistical modeling, specifically mixed modeling to estimate the marginal impact of Balto usage while simultaneously controlling for as many potential confounding factors as possible.","title":"What is DS's specific methodology for conducting the test?"},{"location":"faq/#why-use-a-statistical-model-instead-of-comparing-group-level-averages","text":"Statistical ( regression ) models can account for other sources of variation in the KPI of interest besides Balto/non-Balto group assignment.
